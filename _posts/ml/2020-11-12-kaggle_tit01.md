## Info

> A disproportionate number of men were left aboard because of a "women and children first" protocol for loading lifeboats. - Wikipedia

> These include confusion over the passenger list, which included some names of people who cancelled their trip at the last minute, and the fact that several passengers travelled under aliases for various reasons and were therefore double-counted on the casualty lists. - Wikipedia
